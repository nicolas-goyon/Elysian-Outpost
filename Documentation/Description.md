The project involves revamping a game similar to StoneHearth, with two primary enhancements. Firstly, we're introducing a novel pathfinding algorithm that retains previously calculated paths, akin to a pheromone trail. This approach aims to facilitate new calculations by utilizing existing, quicker paths. The algorithm is based on A-star, but the cost of each block change is contingent on the block type. For instance, a roadblock is favored over a dirt block, and frequently used blocks are also prioritized.
The second major enhancement is ensuring the game functions on computers without a GPU or, at most, an Intel UHD. The goal is to optimize the game for low-end computers.

Unity will be the chosen game engine for this project.

# StoneHearthâ€™s description

StoneHearth is a captivating, open-world game that combines elements of city-building, strategy, and role-playing games (RPG), set in a fantastical, procedurally generated universe. Developed by Radiant Entertainment, the game offers a unique and immersive experience, allowing players to explore, expand, and defend their own thriving settlements.

Key Features:

1. **Procedural Generation**: StoneHearth's expansive world is procedurally generated, offering diverse landscapes, biomes, and endless possibilities for exploration. Each new game presents a unique terrain to conquer, filled with mysterious dungeons, hidden treasures, and intriguing characters.
2. **City-Building**: As the founder of a new settlement, players are tasked with designing, constructing, and managing their own village or city. This includes assigning tasks to the inhabitants (called "Hearthlings"), gathering resources, and ensuring the overall well-being and growth of the settlement.
3. **Customization**: StoneHearth offers a wealth of customization options for both the Hearthlings and the settlements they inhabit. Players can tailor their Hearthlings' appearance, skills, and equipment, while also designing their own buildings, fortifications, and town layouts.
4. **Dynamic Ecosystem**: The game features a complex and interconnected ecosystem, with various flora and fauna that interact with one another and the environment. Players must learn to adapt to the different biomes and exploit their resources to ensure their settlement's survival.
5. **RPG Elements**: In addition to city-building, StoneHearth incorporates RPG elements, allowing players to embark on quests, engage in diplomacy with other factions, and develop their Hearthlings' skills and abilities. As players progress, they'll encounter a rich tapestry of characters, lore, and story-driven events.
6. **Combat and Defense**: To protect their settlement from the dangers of the wilderness, players must recruit and train a militia, construct defensive structures, and devise strategies to repel invaders. Real-time combat allows players to actively engage in battles or issue commands to their Hearthlings.
7. **Crafting and Trade**: A robust crafting system enables players to create a wide variety of items, from weapons and armor to furniture and decorations. Establishing trade routes and negotiating with neighboring settlements can further bolster a player's resources and economic standing.
8. **Modding and Community**: StoneHearth boasts a dedicated modding community that continually expands the game's content through custom scenarios, buildings, items, and more. The game's developers actively support modding, making it easy for players to create and share their own unique additions to the StoneHearth universe.
9. **Art and Music**: The game's charming, voxel-based graphics create a visually appealing and distinctive world, while the original soundtrack composed by Kurtis Seits complements the atmosphere and enhances the overall gaming experience.
10. **Accessibility and Replayability**: StoneHearth's intuitive controls, tutorial system, and adjustable difficulty settings make it welcoming to both newcomers and experienced gamers. The procedurally generated worlds and myriad customization options ensure that each playthrough offers a fresh and engaging experience.
