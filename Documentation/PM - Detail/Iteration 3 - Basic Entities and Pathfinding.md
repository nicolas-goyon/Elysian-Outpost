# **Iteration 3 - Basic Entities and Pathfinding (2-3 weeks)**:

Kanban TODOs (ordered):

- Research basic character design and animation for voxel games.
- Design and create basic 3D models and animations for entities (Hearthlings, animals, etc.).
- Implement entity movement and interaction mechanics.
- Research the A* pathfinding algorithm and its variations.
- Develop the novel pathfinding algorithm based on the A* algorithm.
- Integrate the pathfinding algorithm with the entities and the basic world.
- Test the pathfinding algorithm in the basic world with various scenarios.
