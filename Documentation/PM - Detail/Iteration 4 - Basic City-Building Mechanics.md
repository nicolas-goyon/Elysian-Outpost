# **Iteration 4 - Basic City-Building Mechanics (2-3 weeks)**:

Kanban TODOs (ordered):

- Research basic city-building mechanics in voxel games.
- Design basic building models (houses, workshops, etc.) and their corresponding functionality.
- Implement building placement and construction mechanics.
- Implement resource gathering and management mechanics.
- Implement task assignment mechanics for entities (Hearthlings).
- Test the city-building mechanics in the basic world.
