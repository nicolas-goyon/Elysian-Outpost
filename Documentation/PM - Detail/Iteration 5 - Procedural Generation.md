# **Iteration 5 - Procedural Generation (2-3 weeks)**:

Kanban TODOs (ordered):

- Research procedural generation algorithms for creating diverse landscapes and biomes.
- Implement noise generation algorithms (Perlin, Simplex, etc.) for creating varied terrain.
- Implement biome generation algorithms based on terrain features (elevation, moisture, temperature, etc.).
- Integrate the procedural generation algorithms with the voxel engine.
- Test the procedural generation to ensure it creates varied and interesting worlds.
