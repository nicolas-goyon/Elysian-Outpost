# **Iteration 2 - Basic World Creation (1-2 weeks)**:

Kanban TODOs (ordered):

- Research basic world design principles for voxel games.
- Design a simple game world with basic terrain and blocks (grass, dirt, stone, etc.).
- Create or source basic 3D models and textures for the terrain and blocks.
- Implement the basic world in the voxel engine, including the terrain and blocks.
- Implement basic world interaction mechanics (terrain modification, block placement, etc.).
- Test the basic world to ensure it's correctly rendered and functional.
