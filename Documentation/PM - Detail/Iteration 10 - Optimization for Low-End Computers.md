# **Iteration 10 - Optimization for Low-End Computers (1-2 weeks)**:

Kanban TODOs (ordered):

- Research game optimization techniques for low-end computers.
- Analyze the game's performance on low-end computers using Unity's Profiler.
- Identify areas that need optimization (graphics, AI, performance).
- Implement optimizations such as Level of Detail (LOD) for models, occlusion culling, and AI behavior pooling.
- Test the optimized game to ensure it runs smoothly on low-end computers.
