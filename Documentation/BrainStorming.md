# Idea 1 - Viking theme

One way to change the way the game is, could reside that the game is in the game viking theme and mythology. 

Here are some example : 
1. Dragons: Norse dragons, unlike their Western counterparts, were often depicted as serpentine and did not always breathe fire. They were associated with wisdom and the natural world. The most famous Norse dragon is probably Fafnir from the Volsunga Saga.
    
2. Jormungandr: Also known as the Midgard Serpent, Jormungandr is a sea serpent, the middle child of the giantess Angrboða and the god Loki. It is said to be so large that it encircles the world, biting its own tail.
    
3. Fenrir: A monstrous wolf in Norse mythology, Fenrir is the son of Loki and Angrboða. He is bound by the gods but is prophesied to break free at Ragnarok, the end of the world, and devour the god Odin.
    
4. Trolls: Trolls are typically depicted as ugly, slow-witted, and dangerous creatures that dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves. They are often associated with causing mischief and misfortune.
    
5. Frost Giants: Also known as Jotuns, they are a race of giants who dwell in Jotunheim, one of the Nine Realms. They are often enemies of the gods, but some are also wise and benevolent.
    
6. Valkyries: While not exactly creatures, Valkyries are supernatural female figures who decide who lives and dies in battle. They bring the souls of the bravest warriors to Valhalla, the hall of the slain, ruled over by the god Odin.
    
7. Nidhogg: A dragon/serpent who gnaws at a root of the world tree, Yggdrasil. Nidhogg is a malevolent force associated with death and decay.
    
8. Draugr: Draugr are undead beings who inhabit their graves and often guard treasure. They are strong and difficult to kill, with various supernatural abilities.
    
9. Einherjar: The Einherjar are the spirits of brave warriors who have died in battle and been brought to Valhalla by the Valkyries. They spend their days fighting each other for sport and their nights feasting.
    
10. Hel: Hel is both the name of the Norse underworld and the goddess who rules over it. Half her body is said to be healthy and alive, while the other half is decayed and dead.
